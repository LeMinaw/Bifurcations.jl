# Bifurcations.jl

A partial port of my [Bifurcations](https://github.com/LeMinaw/Bifurcations)
Python module, written in Julia. It greatly improves plotting speed, but is much
more restrictive compared to the original Python software.

## Features

At this moment, it can only plot a system composed of one single population,
thus plotting it very efficiently.
